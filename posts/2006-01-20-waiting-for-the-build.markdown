title: Waiting For the Build
---
So we've been moving over to new computers at work and also upgrading our
compiler and changing virus protection and all that jazz that makes work fun
and enjoyable. One problem we ran into was that our slow build (that runs more
tests) was breaking while our fast build wasn't. Okay, sure, but what was
weird was that it was breaking checking source out from Subversion.

I tackled (along with Brian) this problem today. We had a lot of waiting to
do. So, naturally, we took advantage of our new magnetic whiteboard to produce
this:

Enjoy.
