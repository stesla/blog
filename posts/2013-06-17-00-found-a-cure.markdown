title: I Found a Cure
----
Nearly two weeks ago I posted about [my illness][1]. Well, I've found [a cure][2]. I tried it out on my iPhone last night, and today I installed the chrome app on both of my machines. It's pretty great, and completely destroyed any desire I had to finish writing my own feed reader.

So, if you're still looking for a replacement for Google Reader, I recommend [feedly][2].
