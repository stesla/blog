title: Drawing graphs and automata in LaTeX
---
I am currently enrolled in a class entitled "Automata, Computability, and
Formal Languages" at [UNO][1]. It's a neat class. The professor requires us to
submit our homework in both hard and soft copies. Naturally, he suggests we
use [LaTeX][2] to typeset our homework.

Given that this is a class on automata, I end up drawing a lot of state
diagrams to represent the machines I have to design for the problems. I wanted
a nice way to draw these and put them in to my LaTeX document. The first thing
I did was check to see if [OmniGraffle][3] exported to EPS, and it did. LaTeX
can read EPS, so I was okay if I couldn't find anything better.

With a solution in hand, I started to look and see if there was anything I
could use to typeset these graphs right in the LaTeX source itself. Preferably
something designed for drawing finite state-machines, even. What I found was
[GasTeX][4]. It is a decently cool package.

The following source code from their samples page:

~~~~ {.code}
\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
    \unitlength=4pt
    \begin{picture}(15, 28)(0,-10)
    \gasset{Nw=5,Nh=5,Nmr=2.5,curvedepth=3}
    \thinlines
    \node(A0)(7.5,0){$0$}
    \node[Nmarks=i,iangle=90](A1)(0,13){$1$}
    \node[Nmarks=if,iangle=90,fangle=90](A2)(15,13){$2$}
    \drawloop[loopangle=180](A1){$a$}
    \drawloop[loopangle=0](A2){$b$}
    \drawedge(A1,A2){$a$}
    \drawedge(A2,A1){$b$}
    \drawedge(A2,A0){$a$}
    \gasset{curvedepth=-3}
    \drawedge[ELside=r](A1,A0){$b$}
    \drawloop[loopangle=270](A0){$a, b$}
    \end{picture}
  \end{center}
  \caption{La compl√©tion de l'automate.}
\end{figure}

Generates this graph (which I have scaled down):

One note about this snippet, though, is that I did not have to use the
`center` environment to center the figures. Instead I used the `\centering`
directive inside my `figure` environment, and that worked nicely.

It's nice to use and it makes pretty graphs. I'll be using it for the rest of
the semester, that's for sure!
