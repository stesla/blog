title: First Lawn Mowing Post!
---
Well, I was going to do it Saturday morning (really early before it got hot).
Then I thought, hey I can do it Thursday after I'm done with class but before
I go pick up Erica. Then, tonight, I couldn't wait. I pulled out the lawn-
mower that my co-worker has loaned to me and mowed my front lawn. It's not
that big. It's actually kind of awkwardly shaped due to the large (12-feet in
diameter) evergreen tree taking up much of the area.

It was kind of dark by the time I got mowing, but I think I did a fair job.
We'll see tomorrow, I suppose. I'll be mowing the back tomorrow afternoon.
