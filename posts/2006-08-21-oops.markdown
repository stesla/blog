title: Oops
---
So I'm in my web directory, doing some stuff, and I notice the twiddle backup
files that Emacs leaves when I edit remotely. They bug me. So I did the
following command to remove them.

{% highlight text %}
find . -name *.~?~ -print -o -exec rm {} \;
{% endhighlight %}

Some of you probably think that's just greek. But others are cringing just as
I did when I saw it remove all of the files in my directory. Sooooo, the other
parts of the site are broken until tonight when I can fix them.
