title: Completely Recovered
---
Between my trash folder and cached copies of my pages on [Google][1], I was
able to recover all of the content I had deleted. I took advantage of this
opportunity to redesign the [site][2].

I made a new design, and I like this one much better anyway. So, it all ended
well in the end.
