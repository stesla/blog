title: Rails Talk
---
I gave a talk about [Ruby on Rails][1] at the [Omaha Smalltalk User Group][2]
tonight. It went rather well. I've posted my [slides][3] for anybody that
would like them.

The talk was mostly focused on the Ruby for Smalltalkers portion, but that was
largely because Rails made my demo go so fast that I had to find something to
fill the time with. It was kind of fun, actually, showing everybody around the
Todo project I had made. I haven't really done any serious railing since
version 0.10, and a lot has changed since then. So it was just as exciting for
me to open up some of the files and see how they did things as it was for the
rest of the group.

I've been so busy lately taking classes and buying a house, so I wasn't as
prepared as I would have liked to be. But, everybody seemed to enjoy the talk
and take away something valuable from it, so I'm happy with the talk. I really
enjoyed it, and I think I'm going to try and do more things like this.
