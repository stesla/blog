title: J3Testing 1.0
---
I decided to make my J3TestCase code into an actual framework. This way I
don't have to copy the files each time I want to use the class.

I've put up a disk image with binaries and one with source.

The source is worth looking at, especially to see how I made targets to
automatically build those disk images.

These replace the old J3TestCase code I had posted, and I've removed that
tarball. So, sorry if I broke that link. This is a much better way to deploy
anyway.

_Edited:_ I am no longer providing the disk images mentioned above, so
I've removed the hyperlinks.
