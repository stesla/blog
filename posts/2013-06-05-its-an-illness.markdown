title: It's an Illness
----
It's less than a month before [Google Reader is shutting down][1], and I still haven't decided how I want to continue feeding my RSS-consumption habit. So, tonight I gave it some serious thoughts. I searched around a bit, and saw there are some genuinely good products out there. But, I don't think I'm going to use them, because I have an illness.

See, it can't be that hard to write a simple feed aggregator, right? If it's just for me, then I can make lots of tradeoffs to keep it simple, right? Most importantly, it would be *fun*, right?

It's an illness, I tell you.

Twenty-five days should be more than enough, right?
