title: "Erlang Project: Kickoff"
---
On October 14th, I will be giving a talk at [ODYNUG][1] about advanced
[erlang][2]. Unlike my previous talks, this one is going to delve into the
code of a real application. I'll be discussing the architecture of the
application and the reasons behind the design decisions.

Of course, in order to do that, I need an application. More specifically, I
need an application for which I know all the reasons behind the design
decisions. So, I'm going to write one, and I'm not a person to buck a
tradition, so I'm going to write a blog.

I'll be documenting the process here, and you can see the blog live [here][3].
