title: Coding Challenges
----

For the last year, I haven't done much coding aside from work. Part of
that is because of the kids eating up so much time. Part of that is
because I was choosing to spend my freetime on things like
MUSHing. But, part of it was because I just didn't have a project to
work on.

Inspiration hasn't struck. I have a lot of old projects, but none of
them are very compelling to me right now. I spent a week happily
hacking away on the code I use to generate my blog, and that was fun,
but now that it's working, I don't really have much to do there. I
spent a couple of weeks toying around with [writing a feed
aggregator][1] but ultimately decided to use [something else][2].

So, I've decided to take on a couple of challenges. First, I
<strike>started</strike> resumed working on [Project Euler][3] last
night, and that's fun. I also dashed an email off to get started on
the [Matasano Crypto Challenge][4]. I'm doing both of these in
Haskell, and I'm enjoying myself thoroughly. It's a great way to
exercise my brain.
