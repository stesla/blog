title: I suck at the internet

Well, don't I just suck at the internet?

I'm thinking about moving my blog over to [Typo][1] but first I needed to
delete the 11,000 some odd spam comments that I had. It was too hefty a task
to do manually, so I dipped into the database. I, of course, was confident
that I could do it safely. So, why would I back up the comment table?
Naturally, I did not do it safely and deleted _all_ of my comments instead.

So, I didn't mean to delete all of your comments on purpose. I'm sorry. But,
they're all gone.
