You may have noticed that my layout changed a little. I got rid of my Google
ads.

I've noticed that when I paste code snippets or other bits of pre-formatted
text that is narrower than 80 columns, I still get a horizontal scroll. That
was because my content area was simply too narrow. I intend to be posting more
code, so I started looking for ways to get some space.

Changing the layout to only have one column on the right was a start. I was
simply going to move the google ads down, but then Erica asked me how much
money I was making off of them. The answer is not much at all. So I just got
rid of them entirely.
