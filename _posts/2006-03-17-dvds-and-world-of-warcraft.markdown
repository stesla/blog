That is what I've been doing the last few days. I've been watching DVDs and
playing WoW, and clearly not blogging. What's more, I've had a few ideas for
blog posts (although, I can't remember exactly what they were now). Ah, well,
I'll live. Just not my best week for the blogging goal. I'll do better.

We rented North Country. I can't say that I recommend it. Other than that I've
been busy watching Season 4 of Gilmore Girls, and that I can definitely
recommend. It's one of my favorite shows (no, I don't watch it on TV, just on
DVD, like most television shows I watch). Season 5 is sitting on my shelf just
itching to be played.

Tuesday I did my first instance in WoW with a pick-up group. It went rather
well. I had a blast, and I am looking forward to doing it again. I haven't
been playing a lot lately, but all of the sudden I felt like it, and I had
some fun. So I've been doing some of that the last couple of nights (since I
don't have classes this week).

Tonight I expect to be more of the same, I'll probably finish Season 4 and
maybe run an instance.
