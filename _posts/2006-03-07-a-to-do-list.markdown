Before Spring Break:
<ul>

<li>Analysis homework  (due Thursday).</li>
<li>Review analysis material for exam on Thursday.</li>
<li>Review graph theory material for quiz on Thursday.</li>
<li>Work.</li>
<li>Ben Folds concert.</li>
</ul>

During Spring Break:
<ul>
<li>Install the circuit I built.</li>
<li>Narrow down the topic for my Graph Theory paper.</li>
<li>Read the material for that paper.</li>
<li>Write that paper.</li>
<li>Prepare material for a Mage game that I may or may not run in the future.</li>
<li>Crochet a few rows on my afghan.</li>
<li>Sleep, and get up at 0500 every day.</li>
<li>Blog every day.</li>
</ul>
