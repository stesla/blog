This will be the first of two posts today, as I forgot to post yesterday.
Following in Erica's [footsteps][1], here is my to do list.

Before Spring Break:

* Graph Theory homework (due Thursday).

* Analysis homework (due Thursday).

* Review analysis material for exam on Thursday.

* Review graph theory material for quiz on Thursday.

* Work.

* Ben Folds concert.

During Spring Break:

* Install the circuit I built.

* Narrow down the topic for my Graph Theory paper.

* Read the material for that paper.

* Write that paper.

* Prepare material for a Mage game that I may or may not run in the future.

* Crochet a few rows on my afghan.

* Sleep, and get up at 0500 every day.

* Blog every day.
