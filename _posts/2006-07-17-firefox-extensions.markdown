I recently decided to throw together simple little [Firefox][1] extension.
It's pretty neat how [XUL][2] works. However, setting everything up can be a
bit disorienting. Fortunately I found a good [guide][3]. Between the content
on that page, and the content that it links to, I figured out everything I
needed to know in order to get my extension working.
