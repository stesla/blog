I recently decided to throw together simple little <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox">Firefox</a> extension.  It's pretty neat how <a href="http://www.xulplanet.com">XUL</a> works.  However, setting everything up can be a bit disorienting.  Fortunately I found a good <a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Getting_started_with_extension_development">guide</a>.  Between the content on that page, and the content that it links to, I figured out everything I needed to know in order to get my extension working.
