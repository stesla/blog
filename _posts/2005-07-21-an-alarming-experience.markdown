I'm never the first person to work.  There's always somebody here before me.  Even when I get in early there's somebody here already.  Until today.

How do I know I was the first person in the office?  As soon as I stepped in I heard the klaxon of the alarm go off down the hall.  You see, the first person that comes into the office in the morning has to disable the alarm.  Since I'm never the first person (until now), I figured it had already been disabled.

That was just tons of fun.
