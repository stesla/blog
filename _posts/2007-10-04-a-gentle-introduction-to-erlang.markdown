I gave a talk at [ODYNUG][1] on Tuesday about one of my favorite dynamic
languages: Erlang. It went pretty well, I think. Unlike my Lisp talk from last
year, I don't think I caused too many heads to explode.

I've posted my slides and some example code [here][2].

I'll be giving a talk on ML on Febuary 5, 2008.
