title: A Gentle Introduction to Erlang

I gave a talk at <a href="http://www.blainebuxton.com/odynug/"><acronym title="Omaha Dynamic Language User Group">ODYNUG</acronym></a> on Tuesday about one of my favorite dynamic languages: Erlang.  It went pretty well, I think.  Unlike my Lisp talk from last year, I don't think I caused too many heads to explode.

I've posted my slides and some example code <a href="http://www.alieniloquent.com/talks/erlang-101/">here</a>.

I'll be giving a talk on ML on Febuary 5, 2008.
