Okay, so it seems like over the last few years, so many of my blog posts are
"I am still alive" or "long time no see, I'm going to start blogging again."

The problem is that I've thought of this blog as a technical blog for so long,
and so when I want to talk about other things, I've felt I couldn't post them
here. But, as my better half told me today, "It's called _Alieniloquent_. It's
almost perverse for it to be a single-topic blog."

So, I'm going to start blogging about several topics that interest me:
programming, knitting, cooking, parenting, politics, and whatever else strikes
my fancy. I'm going to make an effort to tag things appropriately so that if
you want to just follow certain kinds of posts, you can.

So, long time no see. I'm going to start blogging again.
