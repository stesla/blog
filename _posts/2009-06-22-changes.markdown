I'm back!

My Spring got swallowed up by the tail-end of my last semester at [UNO][1].
Now it's Summer and I'm living in San Francisco.

That's right, I'm in San Francisco. I was planning on moving out here mid-
July, but circumstances conspired such that I moved out here a week ago. I
already have an [apartment][2], and I'm getting settled in. I was hoping to
get around and visit more of my friends in Omaha before I left, but hey, I'll
be visiting.

I am going to be blogging here again now that my brain isn't getting drained
(filled?) by school. My wife and I are also starting another [blog][3] to talk
about general life stuff.
