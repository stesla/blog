It was <a href="http://blog.alieniloquent.com/2008/09/08/erlang-project-stories/#comment-45637">suggested</a> that I use <a href="http://couchdb.org/">CouchDB</a> as the storage engine for blogerl.  I'm not going to be using CouchDB for this project, and I would like to explain why.

My reason for choosing Git over CouchDB is really just a preference. I think Git is neat, and I want to use it in a novel way. I'd like to demonstrate how it is a very powerful tool and can be used to do more that just version software. I think CouchDB is cool, and at some point, I'll probably do a project with it. But, for this project, it's not what I want.
