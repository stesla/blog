It was [suggested][1] that I use [CouchDB][2] as the storage engine for
blogerl. I'm not going to be using CouchDB for this project, and I would like
to explain why.

My reason for choosing Git over CouchDB is really just a preference. I think
Git is neat, and I want to use it in a novel way. I'd like to demonstrate how
it is a very powerful tool and can be used to do more that just version
software. I think CouchDB is cool, and at some point, I'll probably do a
project with it. But, for this project, it's not what I want.
