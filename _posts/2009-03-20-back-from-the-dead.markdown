title: Back From The Dead
---
Okay, so I died a little.

I've been so busy, and writing on my blog has really just slipped my mind. Let
alone working on side projects like blogerl or VUE.

Anyway, I'm back. I'm going to try and post at least once a week, if not more.
I'm going to start off with some posts explaining how I'm going about solving
a [programming challenge][1] for [ODynUG][2].
