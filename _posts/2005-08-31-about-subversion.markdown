Around my office, I'm generally the guy who knows the most about the non-windows and open source worlds.  That's where I come from, and that's what I stay the most current with.  So, when we started looking for a version control system to replace Visual Source Safe, I immediately started selling <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion</a>.  I succeeded.

Today I gave a lunch-time presentation about Subversion to the whole team.  It was just a short talk with a brief history and a high-level overview of the features.  If you're interested, you can download the <a href="http://www.alieniloquent.com/docs/WhatIsSubversion.pdf">slides</a>.
