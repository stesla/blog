title: About Subversion
---
Around my office, I'm generally the guy who knows the most about the non-
windows and open source worlds. That's where I come from, and that's what I
stay the most current with. So, when we started looking for a version control
system to replace Visual Source Safe, I immediately started selling
[Subversion][1]. I succeeded.

Today I gave a lunch-time presentation about Subversion to the whole team. It
was just a short talk with a brief history and a high-level overview of the
features. If you're interested, you can download the [slides][2].
