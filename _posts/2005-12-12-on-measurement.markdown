<p>So my boss walks into the room and slaps a print-out on the wall with some tape.  It says:</p>
<blockquote><i>Gilb's Law</i>: Anything you need to quantify can be measured in some way that is superior to not measuring at all.
<i>&mdash; (Tom Gilb)</i>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><i>Kent's corollary</i>: Any imperfect measurement can be abused during planning and decision-making by assuming a level of precision greater than what the measurement actually delivers.</blockquote>
