So my boss walks into the room and slaps a print-out on the wall with some
tape. It says:

> _Gilb's Law_: Anything you need to quantify can be measured in some way that
> is superior to not measuring at all.
> _-- (Tom Gilb)_
>
> _Kent's corollary_: Any imperfect measurement can be abused during planning
> and decision-making by assuming a level of precision greater than what the
> measurement actually delivers.
