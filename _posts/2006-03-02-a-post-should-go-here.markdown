It's not until I set the goal to write a blog post every day that I realized I don't always have a topic to write about.  Were I to have a topic, this post would have been about it.  Instead, you get this placeholder post where I talk about the post I would have written.

Let me introduce you to the post I would have written.  It is about a very deep, interesting, and intellectual topic.  In this post I give the topic a brief survey and offer some witty insights and humorous anecdotes.  I conclude the post with a thoughtful one-liner.

Tomorrow I'll make a list of topics.
