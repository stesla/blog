I just wanted to poke my head in and say that I'm still around, and still
working on/thinking about the erlang project. I am, after all, still giving
the talk next month.

I am, however, getting super busy with school. So, I'm having to sit down and
schedule all of my non-work programming time. It's looking like the erlang
project isn't going to get much love until after the end of September.

That said, when I get a few free moments this week, I'll post some code I've
already written that makes a nice interface around shelling out from erlang.
