title: Harry Potter
---
So I bought went to Borders Saturday to buy the latest Harry Potter, and
discovered that I should have reserved a copy ahead of time. They weren't
going to sell the normal edition to me until Monday. However, I could purchase
the [deluxe edition][1], and still read it over the weekend. After consulting
with Erica, I decided to go for it.

And then I read. All day. Until 0300 Sunday morning. But, I finished it. It
was good. I can't wait for book seven (although, it's not like I have a choice
in the whole waiting deal). I'll post more about the book later, but for now,
just know it was good.
