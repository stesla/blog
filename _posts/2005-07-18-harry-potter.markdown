So I bought went to Borders Saturday to buy the latest Harry Potter, and discovered that I should have reserved a copy ahead of time.  They weren't going to sell the normal edition to me until Monday.  However, I could purchase the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0439791324">deluxe edition</a>, and still read it over the weekend.  After consulting with Erica, I decided to go for it.

And then I read.  All day.  Until 0300 Sunday morning.  But, I finished it.  It was good.  I can't wait for book seven (although, it's not like I have a choice in the whole waiting deal).  I'll post more about the book later, but for now, just know it was good.
