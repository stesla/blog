title: WordPress 2.0.4
---
I've been waffling about trying [Typo][1] as my blogging engine. But, I ended
up coming to the same conclusion I came last time I switched away from
Wordpress.

I don't care enough about my blog to code for it. So I don't need to blog with
Ruby, because I'm not going to be coding for my blog. So, I've done what I
should have done a long time ago: I upgraded to the latest version of
[WordPress][2].

The posting interface certainly is sexy. It also comes with a plugin for spam
filtering out of the box, so I don't need the one I was using any more. The
primary reason I did this, though, is that I'm going to be getting into making
a new template for my blog to integrate with the [rest of the site][3], and I
wanted to be on the latest version for the templating stuff.
