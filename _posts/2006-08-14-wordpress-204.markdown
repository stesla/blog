I've been waffling about trying <a href="http://www.typosphere.org/">Typo</a> as my blogging engine.  But, I ended up coming to the same conclusion I came last time I switched away from Wordpress.

I don't care enough about my blog to code for it.  So I don't need to blog with Ruby, because I'm not going to be coding for my blog.  So, I've done what I should have done a long time ago: I upgraded to the latest version of <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>.

The posting interface certainly is sexy.  It also comes with a plugin for spam filtering out of the box, so I don't need the one I was using any more.  The primary reason I did this, though, is that I'm going to be getting into making a new template for my blog to integrate with the <a href="http://www.alieniloquent.com">rest of the site</a>, and I wanted to be on the latest version for the templating stuff.
