I came across this amusing (fictional) story about a <a href="http://blog.objectmentor.com/articles/2008/03/05/turn-back-the-dial">broken watch</a>, and it's impact on the author's development process.

I particularly liked one of the author's comments in the comment thread:

<blockquote>Velocity is a measurement that comes out of development, not an input that goes into it.

[Uncle Bob] said . . . that when you are trying to measure something, itâ€™s counter-productive to put pressure on it.</blockquote>
