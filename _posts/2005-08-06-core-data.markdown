A week ago I read [this presentation][1] by [Wil Shipley][2] (of Omni and
Delicious Library fame). It has inspired me. I'm going to write a Cocoa
program that does something useful and then sell it.

Cocoa is fantastic. It makes things so easy. The best part is, Apple is always
making things easier for developers. One of their latest technologies, [Core
Data][3], makes things orders of magnitude easier for developers. I just put
together a prototype in under two hours (most of which was poking around
documentation since I'm new to using Core Data). I had to write maybe ten
lines of code, and that's because I was doing something a little out of the CD
paradigm. That code will probably go away soon.

My application already knows how to serialize its data, with zero lines of
code from me telling it how. It knows how to add and remove records from a
collection and refresh the UI for it, with zero lines of code. Core Data and
Cocoa Bindings are just awesome.
