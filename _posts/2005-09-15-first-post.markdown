title: First Post
---
Today has been a very long day. To sum it all up, I'll simply tell you what
I'm doing now: blogging from my front porch. That's right, my front porch. I
love wifi. We closed on our house today. We've got internet hooked up. Our bed
is moved. Our cats are moved. All of our dirty laundry is moved, and being
cleaned by means of our new (to us) washer and dryer.

Closing went very smoothly. It went much more smoothly than everybody had led
me to expect. I think it's a big conspiracy amongst homeowners to make new
home-buyers feel like they're going through some big ordeal. Trust me, I know
just how big a deal this should be. 3715 pages to sign and 3024 pages to
initial and 1207 pages to sign confirming that I initialed the 3024 pages and
237 pages to initial confirming I signed the 3715 pages, that's hardly any
paperwork at all. It went by in less than 45 minutes.

It's getting late, so, in short: first post from our new house!
