Right now I'm in my hotel room in Minneapolis.  I'm here for <a href="http://www.agile2006.org">Agile 2006</a> because my work sent me.  Joe went into how we are all <a href="http://excastle.com/blog/archive/2006/07/24/5714.aspx">lucky bastards</a>.  I may blog more about the conference, but maybe not.

I've been spending most of the week writing lisp code.  I'm giving a talk next Tuesday (August 1st) at the <a href="http://www.blainebuxton.com/odynug/">ODYNUG</a> meeting.  It's an introductory course on lisp.  I'll be covering some history of lisp, a programmer's guide to the language, and then some practical examples.  We'll even write some code together.

The location and time is at the link above.  If you have a laptop with wireless, bring it.  There is no projector, but I will be sharing my desktop via VNC.  I will also post all of my code up here on my website after the talk.
