Right now I'm in my hotel room in Minneapolis. I'm here for [Agile 2006][1]
because my work sent me. Joe went into how we are all [lucky bastards][2]. I
may blog more about the conference, but maybe not.

I've been spending most of the week writing lisp code. I'm giving a talk next
Tuesday (August 1st) at the [ODYNUG][3] meeting. It's an introductory course
on lisp. I'll be covering some history of lisp, a programmer's guide to the
language, and then some practical examples. We'll even write some code
together.

The location and time is at the link above. If you have a laptop with
wireless, bring it. There is no projector, but I will be sharing my desktop
via VNC. I will also post all of my code up here on my website after the talk.
