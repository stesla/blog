So I've been thinking about starting some sort of periodic content: perhaps a
regular themed article here or a podcast. I would like to take advantage of
what readers I do have to see what people would like to hear me talk about.

Here are some topics that I've thought about doing:

  * Things about programming they don't teach you in college

  * Agile methods

  * Test-first design

  * Refactoring

  * Cocoa programming

  * Ruby programming

  * Lisp programming

There's no particular order to those, as I find them all very interesting.
It's possible that I could end up doing a mishmash of all of them.

Please leave a comment with a topic you'd like to hear me talk about!
