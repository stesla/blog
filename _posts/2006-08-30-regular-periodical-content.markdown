So I've been thinking about starting some sort of periodic content: perhaps a regular themed article here or a podcast.  I would like to take advantage of what readers I do have to see what people would like to hear me talk about.

Here are some topics that I've thought about doing:

<ul>
<li>Things about programming they don't teach you in college</li>
<li>Agile methods</li>
<li>Test-first design</li>
<li>Refactoring</li>
<li>Cocoa programming</li>
<li>Ruby programming</li>
<li>Lisp programming</li>
</ul>

There's no particular order to those, as I find them all very interesting.  It's possible that I could end up doing a mishmash of all of them.

Please leave a comment with a topic you'd like to hear me talk about!
