On October 14th, I will be giving a talk at <a href="http://odynug.kicks-ass.org"><acronym title="Omaha Dynamic Language User Group">ODYNUG</acronym></a> about advanced <a href="http://www.erlang.org">erlang</a>. Unlike my previous talks, this one is going to delve into the code of a real application. I'll be discussing the architecture of the application and the reasons behind the design decisions.

Of course, in order to do that, I need an application. More specifically, I need an application for which I know all the reasons behind the design decisions. So, I'm going to write one, and I'm not a person to buck a tradition, so I'm going to write a blog.

I'll be documenting the process here, and you can see the blog live <a href="http://omniloquent.com">here</a>.
