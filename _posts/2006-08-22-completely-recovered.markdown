Between my trash folder and cached copies of my pages on <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>, I was able to recover all of the content I had deleted.  I took advantage of this opportunity to redesign the <a href="http://www.alieniloquent.com">site</a>.

I made a new design, and I like this one much better anyway.  So, it all ended well in the end.
