title: Base32 0.1.0 Released
---
As you may know, I've been [working][1] [with][2] base32 encoding. Well, I
decided to share my work with the world in the form of a library.

This first release simply contains the code I needed for my original project,
but I've packaged it up as a nice Ruby extension.

You can visit the project page [here][3].

You can download the release [here][4].
