As you may know, I've been <a href="http://blog.alieniloquent.com/2007/06/05/base32-encoded-freedom/">working</a> <a href="http://blog.alieniloquent.com/2007/06/07/for-those-about-to-base32/">with</a> base32 encoding.  Well, I decided to share my work with the world in the form of a library.

This first release simply contains the code I needed for my original project, but I've packaged it up as a nice Ruby extension.

You can visit the project page <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/base32">here</a>.
You can download the release <a href="http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=3938&release_id=12666">here</a>.
