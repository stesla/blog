I know, I know.  It's been a while since I last blogged (9 days, and longer since it was anything of content).  I've been busy!  Every so often I think to myself "Do I want to blog about what I'm doing, or just do it."  Between work, school, home-ownership, and sleeping...there's not much time to do all the things I find fun.  Sadly, blogging seems to fall to the wayside.

But, I am getting better about sharing with other people.  For the third time in two months, I gave a talk about Ruby at a user group meeting here in Omaha.  This time it was <a href="http://www.ojug.org/">OJUG</a>, and I gave them Jim Weirich's OSCON 2005 talk,  <a href="http://onestepback.org/articles/10things/">"10 Things Java Programmers Should Know About Ruby"</a> (yay for creative commons).  Well, at least I gave a talk using Jim's slides, as they were just perfect.

I've really enjoyed doing this, so I'm going to put this out there.  If you are a group in the Omaha area, and would like to have me come talk about Ruby, shoot me an email.  I'm cheap.  All I need is some free food, and I'm your man.
