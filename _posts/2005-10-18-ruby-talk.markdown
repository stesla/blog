title: Ruby Talk
---
I know, I know. It's been a while since I last blogged (9 days, and longer
since it was anything of content). I've been busy! Every so often I think to
myself "Do I want to blog about what I'm doing, or just do it." Between work,
school, home-ownership, and sleeping...there's not much time to do all the
things I find fun. Sadly, blogging seems to fall to the wayside.

But, I am getting better about sharing with other people. For the third time
in two months, I gave a talk about Ruby at a user group meeting here in Omaha.
This time it was [OJUG][1], and I gave them Jim Weirich's OSCON 2005 talk,
["10 Things Java Programmers Should Know About Ruby"][2] (yay for creative
commons). Well, at least I gave a talk using Jim's slides, as they were just
perfect.

I've really enjoyed doing this, so I'm going to put this out there. If you are
a group in the Omaha area, and would like to have me come talk about Ruby,
shoot me an email. I'm cheap. All I need is some free food, and I'm your man.
