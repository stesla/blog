So I was looking up an actual dictionary definition of "alieniloquent" today.  I had one at some time in the past, but it's a hard word to find in dictionaries, and that's why I picked it for my domain.  I finally found this website, the <a href="http://www.islandnet.com/~egbird/dict/dict.htm">Grandiloquent Dictionary</a>, and it has my word in it.

<dl><dt>alieniloquent</dt><dd>Speaking discursively or straying from one's point.</dd></dl>

So for those of you who were wondering, there you go.
