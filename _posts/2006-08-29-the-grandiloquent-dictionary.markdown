title: The Grandiloquent Dictionary
---
So I was looking up an actual dictionary definition of "alieniloquent" today.
I had one at some time in the past, but it's a hard word to find in
dictionaries, and that's why I picked it for my domain. I finally found this
website, the [Grandiloquent Dictionary][1], and it has my word in it.

alieniloquent
: Speaking discursively or straying from one's point.

So for those of you who were wondering, there you go.
