Having made my declaration of goals yesterday, I did some thinking. I'm really
looking forward to my dietary changes. I'm also really looking forward to the
regular blogging.

As she always does, Erica found me some reading about polyphasic sleep. Now
keep in mind, she's the one that seeded the idea in my head to start with.
Upon reading these articles, I am still incredibly curious to see how it would
be. However, I think that it will be more practical for me to simply work on
being an early riser and perhaps take a nap in the afternoon: biphasic sleep.

I'm going to replace the polynapping goal with a different one, and I'll start
it the same day: get up at 5AM every morning.

Now, there are a number of things that will contribute to this goal. First,
I'm giving up caffeine. This is part of the Atkins diet, but it certainly
won't harm my sleep habits. In fact, I started going caffeine-free today,
since I know I can do it whenever I choose (I've done it before, caffeine is
always a conscious choice). I'm certainly feeling a little more weary tonight
than I would had I had my coffee and cola today, but I will go to bed sooner
and feel rested in the morning.

I might revisit the polynapping again sometime in the future when I'm self-
employed (that's a goal of mine, you know).
