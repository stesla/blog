An astute reader may notice the new category and link in my sidebar.  <a href="http://ocfit.tigris.org">OCFit</a> is a project I've been working on for a few weeks (well, really just a couple of weekends over the last few weeks).  It is intended to be a replacement for <a href="http://fit.c2.com">Fit</a> for Cocoa developers.  I started it because I could not find the Objective C implementation of Fit, and when I did, I just could not bring myself to use it.  I've set out to write a program that follows the spirit of Fit, but is idiomatic to Objective C.

Right now the framework only provides PrimitiveFixture and ColumnFixture.  I will be implementing ActionFixture soon.
