An astute reader may notice the new category and link in my sidebar.
[OCFit][1] is a project I've been working on for a few weeks (well, really
just a couple of weekends over the last few weeks). It is intended to be a
replacement for [Fit][2] for Cocoa developers. I started it because I could
not find the Objective C implementation of Fit, and when I did, I just could
not bring myself to use it. I've set out to write a program that follows the
spirit of Fit, but is idiomatic to Objective C.

Right now the framework only provides PrimitiveFixture and ColumnFixture. I
will be implementing ActionFixture soon.
