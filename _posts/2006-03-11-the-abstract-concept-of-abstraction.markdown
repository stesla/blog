So, last weekend, we bought a [grill][1]. Yesterday we got the gas line
installed in our house so that we could use the grill. Naturally, I was
planning on having steaks for dinner.

Long about 0930, I get a call from Erica while I'm at work. "Hey honey, I know
you're excited about grilling. I'm excited about hanging out with my friends.
Can I have some of my physics-major friends over?" I figured, sure, why not?
They're my friends too. The more the merrier.

Well, there were more. I ended up cooking for twelve people. Pleasantly, my
grill has _plenty_ of room to cook on. I cooked steaks for most people,
chicken breasts for a couple, burgers for a couple and lots of veggies (bell
peppers, squash, tomatoes, zucchini, and onions). It was all really very good.

Party continued. Margaritas were had. We burned the chiminea again, and I
ended up watching the fire burn down while everybody else played Outburst. I
enjoyed that. Then we all played charades until midnight when I went to bed. I
assume the party continued after that, but I'm not sure how long because
despite their volume, I was out cold in five minutes.

So, that's why there was no blogging yesterday. I spent from about 1700 - 0000
entertaining. It was fun, though. Expect more bloggy goodness from me today.
