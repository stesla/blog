Over the past two years I've hopped around from blogging tool to blogging
tool, and many of my blog posts have fallen to the wayside. Pleasantly to my
surprise, _somebody_ was backing them up for me. Yay for the [Internet Wayback
Machine][1]. So, Sherman, it's time we take a trip back to...May 4, 2004 on
this very blog...

With apologies to Frank Herbert:

> I must not prematurely optimize. Premature optimization is the mind-killer.
> Premature optimization is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I
> will face my desire to prematurely optimize. I will permit it to pass over me
> and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its
> path. Where the desire has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.
