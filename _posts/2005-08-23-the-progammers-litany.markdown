<p>Over the past two years I've hopped around from blogging tool to blogging tool, and many of my blog posts have fallen to the wayside.  Pleasantly to my surprise, <em>somebody</em> was backing them up for me.  Yay for the <a href="http://www.archive.org">Internet Wayback Machine</a>.  So, Sherman, it's time we take a trip back to...May 4, 2004 on this very blog...</p>

<p>With apologies to Frank Herbert:</p>

<blockquote>I must not prematurely optimize. Premature optimization is the mind-killer. Premature optimization is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my desire to prematurely optimize. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the desire has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.</blockquote>
