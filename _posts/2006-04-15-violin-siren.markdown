So we were at Jonesy's Dinner Den on Maple eating our food (which was very
good) and watching the five o'clock news on their TV. The weather guy was
going on about the possible tornado cells that were west of Omaha and moving
easterly. In the background KVNO was playing some classical music.

That's when we heard the sirens. Everybody paused and looked up at everybody
else, and then the woodwinds kicked in. They weren't sirens after all, just
violins. It was a tense second, and then everybody laughed.
