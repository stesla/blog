Well, we sat down to do some budgeting, and one of the things that got trimmed
was our cell-phone service. The timing was very good: our contract just ended
last week. So, we no longer have our cell phones. If you had my (or
[Erica][1]'s) phone number before, just post a comment or send me an email and
I'll let you know what the new number is.
