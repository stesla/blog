Well, we sat down to do some budgeting, and one of the things that got trimmed was our cell-phone service.  The timing was very good: our contract just ended last week.  So, we no longer have our cell phones.  If you had my (or <a href="http://www.sperari.com">Erica</a>'s) phone number before, just post a comment or send me an email and I'll let you know what the new number is.
