I'm a gamer.  Mostly old-fashioned, pencil-and-paper, roleplaying games.  I do play <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com">World of Warcraft</a>, but my favorites are table-top RPGs.

I've played a lot of different games: AD&D, d20 D&D, Vampire, Werewolf, Changeling, Mage, Hunter, GURPS, 7th Sea, Shadowrun, Cyberpunk: 2020, Call of Cthulu, and some homebrew systems.  Each has a different style.  Each has a different mixture of rolling dice and playing roles.  Sometimes these two facets are called roll-playing and role-playing.

I'll be honest, I prefer role-playing to the alternative.  If I wanted to sit around and throw pieces of plastic the whole time, I wouldn't need to come up with worlds and stories.  Don't get me wrong, I think dice have a place in a game, but I don't think they should be at the forefront.  Consequently, I don't like games that are heavy on combat.  It doesn't matter which system you play in, combat is inevitably the least role-playing you do in a session.

So of the games I've played, I tend to prefer the <a href="http://www.white-wolf.com">White Wolf</a> World of Darkness games, my favorite being Mage (2nd Edition, in particular).    It is very story heavy, and that's what I like.  The game is all about playing characters and solving problems.  Sure, there's combat, but it's all very plot-driven.  You don't do a dungeon crawl in mage, you infiltrate the Syndicate front's corporate headquarters to get the vitally important documents that explain the wave of mysterious drug-related deaths in the local area.

My regular gaming group wasn't getting into Mage.  Erica and I suggested that we play D&D.  She and I knew that we could attempt to make D&D fun for us (by making interesting characters and roleplaying them).  We've played a couple of sessions as of tonight and, well, the game is about what D&D usually is: a lot of rolling.  

I'm trying to have fun, but between throwing down dice and looking up rules, I can't say that there's much room for it.
