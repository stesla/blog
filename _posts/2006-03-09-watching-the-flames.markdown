When we bought this house, we made sure to ask for the cast-iron chiminea that
the previous owners had. They let us have it (along with a lot of other
stuff). That was back in September. We were very excited because it was still
the right season to burn the chiminea, but we never did.

Tonight we had company over and since the weather was nice enough (I look at
the weather widget and see it's only 4 degrees above freezing, I guess I have
a weird definition of nice enough) we decided to eat out on the deck and start
up a fire. The wood was wet, although imperceptibly so, as it had been in the
chiminea since the aborted attempt at burning back in early November. But,
after a bit of work, I got a nice fire going.

Three hours later, I've finally come in from the deck to go to bed. It was
enjoyable watching the fire burn down. I forgot how much I enjoy watching the
flames dance back and forth. Watch the glow of the wood as it sits there and
smolders. The smell of the smoke from good wood. The (little bit of) radiant
heat. It reminded me of my Boy Scout days just a little.

We'll be burning a lot this spring.
