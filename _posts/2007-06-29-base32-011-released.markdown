Quickly on the heels of the [initial release][1] of my Base32 library, I have
an update. I should have tried to compile it on Linux, as the GCC settings on
my Gentoo box caught some silly things I had done.

It's all better now, and the gem can install on both Mac OS X and Gentoo
Linux. I assume other Linuxes are probably fine, as are BSDs and other \*NIXes.

To download it go [here][2].
