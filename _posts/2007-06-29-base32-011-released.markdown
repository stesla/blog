Quickly on the heels of the <a href="http://blog.alieniloquent.com/2007/06/28/base32-010-released/">initial release</a> of my Base32 library, I have an update.  I should have tried to compile it on Linux, as the GCC settings on my Gentoo box caught some silly things I had done.

It's all better now, and the gem can install on both Mac OS X and Gentoo Linux.  I assume other Linuxes are probably fine, as are BSDs and other *NIXes.

To download it go <a href="http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=3938&release_id=12678">here</a>.
