I've posted about this in the past (although, the posts aren't around any
more). I've always thought that DST was just silly, but apparently I'm in the
minority, as Congress has just passed a [bill to extend DST by four weeks][1].

Yay! Let's give the people _more_ of a stupid thing. Of all the great ideas
Ben Franklin had, why, why, _why_ did anybody listen to this one?
