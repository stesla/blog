I've posted about this in the past (although, the posts aren't around any more).  I've always thought that DST was just silly, but apparently I'm in the minority, as Congress has just passed a <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/07/22/congress.daylighttime.ap/index.html">bill to extend DST by four weeks</a>.

Yay!  Let's give the people <em>more</em> of a stupid thing.  Of all the great ideas Ben Franklin had, why, why, <em>why</em> did anybody listen to this one?
