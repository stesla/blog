title: Pardon the mess

For those who actually read my site at my site, please pardon my mess. I'm
redesigning my site, and I have much less regard for how it looks than some,
so I'm just going to piddle with it live.

On the up side, if you're the kind that obsessively refreshes my blog, you can
see how I design web pages.
