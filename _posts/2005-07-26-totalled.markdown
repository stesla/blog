title: Totalled
---
Well, I got a call from State Farm and the little [accident][1] I had, will
indeed total out my poor little Rio. I'm getting the full retail value for the
vehicle, and thankfully I have gap insurance for my car loan, as I don't think
that will entirely cover the amount I owe.

Next month I'll be shopping for a new vehicle. If I can find a pickup that I
can afford, I think I'll go with that. I want the ability to move things
around.
