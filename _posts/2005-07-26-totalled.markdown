Well, I got a call from State Farm and the little <a href="http://www.alieniloquent.com/2005/07/15/interesting-times-indeed/">accident</a> I had, will indeed total out my poor little Rio.  I'm getting the full retail value for the vehicle, and thankfully I have gap insurance for my car loan, as I don't think that will entirely cover the amount I owe.

Next month I'll be shopping for a new vehicle.  If I can find a pickup that I can afford, I think I'll go with that.  I want the ability to move things around.
