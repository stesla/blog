I have moved my blog. It is now [here][1]. Most of you are probably getting to
this notice via my old URI. Please update. All you need to do is change "www"
to "blog" and you're set.

I've set up a rewrite rule that will redirect from the old URI scheme to the
new one. As this is a permanent relocation, that redirect will eventually go
away (I want to use the www space for other things). At that point I will
probably set up a smart 404 handler that will try to preserve links as best as
it can, but please update them anyway.
