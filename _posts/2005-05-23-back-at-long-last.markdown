I've been gone for quite some time.  Well, not gone, but not blogging.  The blog has, in fact, been gone.

In short, <a href="http://www.arete.cc/2005/05/23/arete-returns/">Arete was hacked</a>.  Tyler and I had to reinstall.  That is a blog post all on its own.  We finally were back up and running with most things about a week and a half ago.  But, for whatever reason, Rouhgcut wouldn't work.

It seems something changed from Rails 0.10 to 0.12 that broke it.  So my blog remained down, as I didn't want to bother fixing it.  I'm now using WordPress, and I think I'll stay with it.  While I don't like PHP, I do like blog software that Just Works and requires Very Little Effort On My Part.  Despite all my posturing, writing code for my blog doesn't excite me very much, and so what language the blogging tool is written in isn't nearly as important.

I'll be importing all of my old entries (well the ones that were in roughcut, at least) very soon.
