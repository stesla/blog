I'm trying to blog more, so here's an update on the house. We got a counter-
offer last night and had negotiated to an agreement we all liked by 1100 this
morning. By noon they had signed it and I had signed it and it was all locked
in. We got them to agree to sell us the washer, drier, and some furniture we
liked (on top of the other appliances they were already planning to sell us).
It's so exciting. Now all the real work begins (including the cashflow
management to make sure we have the money to pay things when we need to up
until closing).

We put the closing date at September 15th, so we should have two weeks to move
in after we close. We'll be moving during school, but it'll be before it gets
cold. Altogether, a good deal, I think.

I'm so stoked.
