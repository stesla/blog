Well, don't I just suck at the internet?

I'm thinking about moving my blog over to <a href="http://www.typosphere.org">Typo</a> but first I needed to delete the 11,000 some odd spam comments that I had.  It was too hefty a task to do manually, so I dipped into the database.  I, of course, was confident that I could do it safely.  So, why would I back up the comment table?  Naturally, I did not do it safely and deleted <em>all</em> of my comments instead.

So, I didn't mean to delete all of your comments on purpose.  I'm sorry.  But, they're all gone.
