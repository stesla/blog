I've waited and waited and waited.  Now the waiting is finally over.  I have in my possession a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1588464180">Mage: the Awakening</a>, and I'm stoked.  I would have said something yesterday, when I actually bought it, but I was too busy reading.
