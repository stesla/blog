I just got back to the office after giving a talk to the <a href="http://www.omahaspin.org">Omaha <acronym title="Software Process Improvement Network">SPIN</acronym></a> group.  It was a report on the experiences we've had and the lessons we've learned at my current employer over a year and a half of using agile methods.

If you'd like to look at my slides, they're <a href="http://www.alieniloquent.com/talks/profitstars-xp/ProfitstarsExperienceReport.pdf">here</a>.
