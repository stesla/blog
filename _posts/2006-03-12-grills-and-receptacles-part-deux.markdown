Two weekends in a row this has been the topic du jour. It's like grilling and
electrical work go together. Like chocolate and mint, or swearing and hockey.

This afternoon I had the house to myself for a blessed hour and a half. I took
that golden opportunity to shut all the power off in the house and install my
new circuit, and it worked! Well, after a little coaxing. Once the breaker was
installed and I turned the power back on, I discovered I had miswired one of
the receptacles. They are all GFCI receptacles, so they just wouldn't reset
the right way. A little work and I got it all taken care of. So I've got more
power in my basement and the server migration is ready for phase two: getting
the nice internet pipe in the basement.

Today also illustrated for me _just_ how nice having a natural gas grill out
on the deck is. I can go out there, fire it up and throw down some food any
time I want. If it's smoky, the main floor of the house won't get filled, and
all of the food has that delicious flame-licked taste. I made burgers, salmon,
and garlic bread on the grill today. I'm of the opinion that most everything
is better when cooked over actual fire.
