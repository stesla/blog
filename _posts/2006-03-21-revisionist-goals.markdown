I've been doing Atkins since Thursday.  I'm past the energy slump and back to normal.  It takes a little more effort to be as lazy as I like to about cooking and also do this diet, but the new grill helps.  Mmm, steak.

The sleeping goal, not so much.  The first week I managed.  Since then I have not.  I am still shooting for 0500, but I have not been succeeding for various reasons.  Most of them have to do with the fact that when I get up at 0500, there's nothing I can think of that sounds better than crawling back into bed.  I'm awake, sure.  I'm not tired.  But, the siren song of my sheets is calling to me.  

The diet is providing some motivation to get up earlier: breakfast.  I like to start the day with at least four pieces of bacon and two eggs.  That takes some time to cook right, and so I need to give myself that time.  That means I can't snooze until the last minute and get a sandwich at McDonalds any more.  So, I'm working on it.

Blogging hasn't happened every day.  Sometimes I've forgotten.  Sometimes I've procrastinated it until I fall asleep.  Sometimes I haven't had anything I felt I could squeeze a blog post out of.  But, I'm falling short of my every-day goal.

I am, however, a believer in adjusting goals to be realistic.  I do this at my job all of the time.  When we realize that a software task is impossible, we figure out how to make it possible and still get as much value as we can.  Blogging daily probably isn't impossible, just improbable.  The value I wanted to get out of it was to write regularly.  Based on that fact, I'm going to scale back to blogging a minimum of three times a week, and more if I feel moved to.
