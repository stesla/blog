I'm reading <a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails2/index.html">Agile Web Development With Rails</a> and I just have to share this most amusing quote:

<blockquote>AJAX (which once stood for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML but
now just means Making Browsers Suck Less)</blockquote>

Thank you Dave and Dave for calling things like they really are.
