title: The true meaning of AJAX
---
I'm reading [Agile Web Development With Rails][1] and I just have to share
this most amusing quote:

> AJAX (which once stood for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML but
> now just means Making Browsers Suck Less)

Thank you Dave and Dave for calling things like they really are.
