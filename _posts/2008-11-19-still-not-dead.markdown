So, the October ODYNUG meeting came and went, and it was great. My talk went well, despite my not having written my blogging tool.

It is amazing how busy a person can get with what seems like only a few things on his plate. Between my classes and work, I've been staying busy. I tried to do <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a>, but failed. I couldn't even get a thousand words written because I am so busy.

I realized I hadn't updated since September, and wanted to poke my head in and let you all know that in a month, I won't be so busy. Come the middle of December, I'll start working on blogerl again. I've made some design re-decisions. I'm basically going to be doing something similar to <a href="http://blosxom.sourceforge.net/">blosxom</a>. It meshes well with my design goals, and I can even keep my posts in git if I want.
