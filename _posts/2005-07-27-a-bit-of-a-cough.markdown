So for the last week and a half I've had this cough, and it just won't go
away. I haven't had any sinus problems, and I really haven't had any breathing
problems. I just cough a lot. Most of the time I don't cough up anything.
Monday I went to the doctor.

The doctor looked me over, and listened to me breath with the stethoscope.
Then, he told me, "well, son, you've got a cough." Thanks, tell me something I
didn't know. His diagnosis was that I had some sort of viral irritation in my
throat (which, as everybody knows, is where the coughing reflex lives) and
that there wasn't a whole lot we could do about it. He prescribed some anti-
inflammatory drug for me to take in the morning and suggested I take some
Tussin DM in the evening ("You'll have to take a whole slug, though--3
teaspoons at least").

The drugs are helping. The cough isn't as bothersome now. But, hoo boy, I
can't wait for it to actually be gone.
