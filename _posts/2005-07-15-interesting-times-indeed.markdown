So, a couple weeks ago, my friend Joe got in a [car accident][1]. Erica and I
went and helped him and his wife out that afternoon. Little did we know that
the car accident virus was being passed on to us.

I got rear-ended on the way home from work. I was traveling east on 72nd near
Dodge (right by where I live) and the traffic was backed up (which it
frequently is there). I came to a stop, and the guy behind me thought I was
moving. The result? My bumper was bent so far under my car it rubs up against
the rear wheel. Not exactly drivable.

Nobody was hurt. The guy was nice. I'm still waiting to talk to his insurance
people, but I'm sure things will work out just fine. Not exactly my idea of
fun.
