title: New design
---
Well, it only took me one night. I'll probably be tweaking for weeks now, but
I got the main thrust of theming done.

I really have to compliment the [Wordpress][1] guys. Setting up a theme for
their system can be as easy or as difficult as the particular designer wants.
Their theme system is definitely the way to go for live blog redesigns,
though: I could switch back to the other theme with a couple of mouse clicks.
Very easy.

Let me know what you think of the design.
