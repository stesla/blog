Well, it only took me one night.  I'll probably be tweaking for weeks now, but I got the main thrust of theming done.

I really have to compliment the <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> guys.  Setting up a theme for their system can be as easy or as difficult as the particular designer wants.  Their theme system is definitely the way to go for live blog redesigns, though: I could switch back to the other theme with a couple of mouse clicks.  Very easy.

Let me know what you think of the design.
