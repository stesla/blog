title: Prodigal Blogger Returns

Hi. I know it's been a long time. Things have been crazy-busy for me all
summer, and as usual, the blog fell by the wayside.

One of the things keeping me busy has been my new job. Yes, I got _another_
new job. Since June, I've been working at [Engine Yard][1] as a developer on
the Vertebra project, and recently I've taken over as development lead. It's
very exciting and fulfilling to be working on such an interesting problem.

I've also been speaking and traveling quite a bit. I spoke at both
[BarCampKC][2] and [BarCampOmaha][3], and my usual user group talks.

But, the real reason I haven't written since March, is that I just haven't had
ideas about which I wanted to write. I finally decided that I needed to start
writing even if I couldn't think of anything to write about. Of course, at
that moment, an idea occurred to me.

I'm going to be starting a series of posts over the next month. I'm working on
a project for my Advanced Erlang talk next month at [ODYNUG][4], and I'm going
to blog about it.
