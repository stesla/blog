Ben was fantastic.  This is actually the first time I've seen him play with anything resembling a band: a drummer and a bass player.  Although I didn't know he was going to have a band, it was a pleasant surprise.  The previous three shows I've been to, he's been solo.  There are definitely some songs that were much better with the added guys, especially because of the extra vocals that Ben just can't do on his own.  That said, I still like him a lot on his own.

I'll let Erica post a set list because she knows all the titles.  He did play his staple gig songs: Army, Philosophy, and Not The Same.  He also did a cover of Dr. Dre's Bitches Ain't Shit, which was hilarious.  He informed us all that he no longer Rocks This Bitch, nor does he Rock Out With His Cock Out, and he did it in the form of a folk song.

Amusingly, he seemed to be up on the whole purchase of the Ranchbowl and planned Wal-Mart conversion.  In his words, "I've played Wal-Mart now."

Ben continues to be my favorite concert performer, and about the only act I'll always go see if I can.  In fact, if I didn't have an exam on Thursday, I'd go see him again at the show in Des Moines.
