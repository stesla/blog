Erica started [crocheting][1] [again][2]. She's pretty excited about her
projects. I am too. She's really starting to make some nice things. Aside from
the hats, she's working on an afghan pattern that came on the yarn we bought
at Wal-Mart it's really neat.

I've known how to crochet since I was ten or so. Back then I pretty much just
made hot pads and trivets. Lots of squares. But, it was fun and I felt crafty.
Then, a few years back, when Erica and I both had phone jobs in Colorado, we
both decided to crochet scarves for each other. We never finished them, but it
was really fun. We'd be sitting there crocheting while we did internet tech
support. It's soothing.

So, seeing Erica get all excited about making pretty things out of yarn, I
decided I should pick up a project too. Naturally, I decided to start big: 36
square feet of afghan. I'm using a nice double-crochet chevron pattern and
it's looking quite nice. Right now it's about six feet by eleven inches. I've
only got 61 inches to go before it's square. I should have it done by the time
fall rolls around.

I really enjoy crochet because it's something I can do that requires skill but
not a lot of thinking. When I come home from work and class, my brain can
sometimes get pretty fried. So having an activity that I can do that is
effectively brainless but that still lets me make pretty things, is awesome.

I'll be sure to get Erica to post pictures of my afghan when it's done.
