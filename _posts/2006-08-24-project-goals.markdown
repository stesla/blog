Erica posted her <a href="http://www.sperari.com/archives/2006/08/24/creative-goals/">creative goals</a>, and I figured I'd do the same.
<ul>
	<li>I'm working on a Mac app that will interface with <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/">Google Calendar</a> and iCal to help schedule free time.  It'll be ideal for students who want to plan their homework or freelance workers who need to break up their day.  Erica's going to be cutting her Cocoa teeth on this project with me, but I'm doing most of the backend work.</li>
	<li>There are a couple of <a href="http://rubyonrails.com/">Ruby on Rails</a> projects I'd like to play with.</li>
	<li>I think it is high time I revisit <a href="http://ocfit.tigris.org/">OCFit</a> and get more done there.</li>
	<li>I want to post more frequently and with some sort of theme.  I think it'll be largely programming focused.</li>
	<li>I would like to find more <a href="http://www.alieniloquent.com/talks/">speaking engagements</a>.</li>
</ul>
So those are a few things that I'm looking at doing aside from work and school this semester.
