I was making sure everything was in order for my talk tomorrow for <a href="www.blainebuxton.com/odynug/">ODYNUG</a>, and I discovered that the venue has changed.

Apparently Cafe Gelato, where ODYNUG has been having its meetings, went out of business.  So my talk will be at the <a href="http://www.panerabread.com/">Panera</a> at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=13410%20W%20Maple%20Rd&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&sa=N&tab=wl">132nd and Maple</a>.
