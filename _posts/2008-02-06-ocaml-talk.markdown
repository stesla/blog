So, I was going to give a talk on <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/">OCaml</a> at <a href="http://odynug.blainebuxton.com/">ODYNUG</a> last night. But, well, snow happened, and the meeting was canceled.

I will be giving the talk next month, on March 4th along with <a href="http://bablingmonkey.blogspot.com/">Brent Adkisson</a> who will be giving a talk about <a href="http://code.google.com/android/">Android</a>.
