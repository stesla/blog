  <h3><a href="/2006/09/21/movie-reviews-all-the-kings-men.html" title="Permalink for this post">Movie Reviews: All the King's Men</a></h3>
  <p class="date">September 21st, 2006</p>
  <div class="entry"><p>When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d ever see it. The story didn&#8217;t seem like the kind I tend to enjoy. But, when a friend of mine offered to give me some free tickets I figured it was worth seeing for free, and it&#8217;s a good thing I did. This way I can tell you about how terrible the movie is, and hopefully save you some cash.</p>

<p>The budget for the film was $55 million. A fairly small budget by Hollywood standards, but in the same range as the last three films I saw: The Covenant ($20 million), Snakes on a Plane ($36 million), World Trade Center ($65 million). I liked all of those films, but I didn&#8217;t like this one, and I think it really comes down to how the budget was spent.</p>

<p>Two places the producers clearly did <em>not</em> spend their budget was on cinematography or editing. In no fewer than four scenes I saw the head of a boom mic bouncing along the top of the screen, and in one scene I saw the mic and its boom in their entirety. This isn&#8217;t like a car in Lord of the Rings. This is just shoddy movie-making.</p>

<p>Another place they clearly did not spend their money was writing. I&#8217;m sure that the book this movie was based on was a fine novel. I know there was a real story about Huey Long, whom this story is loosely about. Somehow, though, the writers for this film failed to caputre any real plot. None. None at all.</p>

<p>I think where they spent almost all their money was on casting. The movie had an amazing cast: Sir Anthony Hopkins, Jude Law, Kate Blanchett, Mark Ruffalo, Sean Penn, and James Gandolfini. Those are some big names, and I&#8217;m sure they all had nice fat paychecks for their performances. The performances were even decent, although Penn summoned memories of Snatch with his thick, unintelligible accent.</p>

<p>So, if you want to play spot-the-mic, or want to see if you can find the plot, go see this movie. But, if you want to enjoy the two hours you&#8217;ll spend watching it, go do something else.</p></div>
