  <h3><a href="/2006/03/21/revisionist-goals.html" title="Permalink for this post">Revisionist Goals</a></h3>
  <p class="date">March 21st, 2006</p>
  <div class="entry"><p>I&#8217;ve been doing Atkins since Thursday. I&#8217;m past the energy slump and back to normal. It takes a little more effort to be as lazy as I like to about cooking and also do this diet, but the new grill helps. Mmm, steak.</p>

<p>The sleeping goal, not so much. The first week I managed. Since then I have not. I am still shooting for 0500, but I have not been succeeding for various reasons. Most of them have to do with the fact that when I get up at 0500, there&#8217;s nothing I can think of that sounds better than crawling back into bed. I&#8217;m awake, sure. I&#8217;m not tired. But, the siren song of my sheets is calling to me.</p>

<p>The diet is providing some motivation to get up earlier: breakfast. I like to start the day with at least four pieces of bacon and two eggs. That takes some time to cook right, and so I need to give myself that time. That means I can&#8217;t snooze until the last minute and get a sandwich at McDonalds any more. So, I&#8217;m working on it.</p>

<p>Blogging hasn&#8217;t happened every day. Sometimes I&#8217;ve forgotten. Sometimes I&#8217;ve procrastinated it until I fall asleep. Sometimes I haven&#8217;t had anything I felt I could squeeze a blog post out of. But, I&#8217;m falling short of my every-day goal.</p>

<p>I am, however, a believer in adjusting goals to be realistic. I do this at my job all of the time. When we realize that a software task is impossible, we figure out how to make it possible and still get as much value as we can. Blogging daily probably isn&#8217;t impossible, just improbable. The value I wanted to get out of it was to write regularly. Based on that fact, I&#8217;m going to scale back to blogging a minimum of three times a week, and more if I feel moved to.</p></div>
