  <p class="date">March 13th, 2006</p>
  <div class="entry"><p>Life is full of tough decisions. It is, in fact, itself a series of decisions, and many of them are tough. So far, I&#8217;ve had a mix of them. The funny thing is, I made a lot of decisions that are hard for most people with ease.</p>

<p>I dropped out of college. I got married, and have remained blissfully so. I picked up all of my earthly posessions and moved a state away to seek out better fortune. I left a steady job for a new, better, shinier job, and then did it again three months later (and have been in that position for the last two years). I just bought a house six months ago.</p>

<p>I read. I know that many people stress out and toil over those kinds of decisions, and all of them have just come to me. When I needed to make a decision, I just did it. Yeah, it was stressful, but the right choice came to me. But now, I&#8217;m sitting here in my house and I&#8217;m thinking about the future. I&#8217;ve got everything (mostly) planned out through my graduation, which will be in Spring of 2010. That&#8217;s right, boys and girls, I have another six semesters after this one before I graduate (wow, it&#8217;s into the single digits at least).</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure what I want to do after I finish school. I&#8217;m already employed, and as much as I love my job, I don&#8217;t want to work there forever. I want to start a business, but hell if I know what. I&#8217;ve considered graduate school, but I frequently reconsider (and then reconsider reconsidering). When I get my degree in four years, I&#8217;ll be done with the part of my life that&#8217;s been planned.</p>

<p>A few years ago, that would have seemed like forever (indeed, I remember thinking just that), but now that seems like it will be just around the corner. I feel unprepared. I wish I could find that resolve that I had as a young child when I said I wanted to be an astronaut, and then a fireman, and then a chemist, and then and then and then.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll decide when the time comes, but it&#8217;s this waiting that&#8217;s killing me.</p></div>
