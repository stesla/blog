  <div class="entry"><p>I know I promised more blogging. I know it&#8217;s been weeks. I <em>have</em> been working on my blog, just behind the scenes.</p>

<p>I decided that if I was going to start blogging seriously, I did not want to be doing it in a web form. I&#8217;ve been using <a href='http://wordpress.org/'>WordPress</a> for a long time now, and the biggest thing that has always bugged me were my options for actually typing in my blog posts. Web forms suck for writing. I&#8217;d rather use Emacs.</p>

<p>Now, I realize there&#8217;s ways to use Emacs to post to WordPress. I&#8217;m not interested. The second thing that bugged me about my old setup is the database. This is a blog. Except for comments and track-backs, it is essentially static content. There is no reason to bring a database into this transaction.</p>

<p>So, I started considering doing something simple that would generate my content statically. I could store it in a Git repository and push it up to my server. That&#8217;s when I remembered <a href='http://jekyllrb.com'>Jekyll</a>. It was pretty much exactly what I wanted, and it&#8217;s written in Ruby, so I&#8217;ll be comfortable hacking on it when the need arises.</p>

<p>The trouble was that Jekyll doesn&#8217;t have a lot of built-in generation options. It will generate a page for each post, and it will run any extra files through its template expansion, but for things like archive pages some extra code is needed. But, Jekyll provides a plugin mechanism that is more than adequate to allow for extension.</p>

<p>As part of this migration, I&#8217;ve decided to remove the commenting and track-backing functionality from my blog. Experience has shown that I don&#8217;t really get much in the way of comments, and I believe there are better ways to facilitate discussion. If, later, I feel that I should have comments, I&#8217;ll probably use <a href='http://disqus.com'>Disqus</a>.</p>

<p>I also made a little tweak so that only new posts should show up in the RSS feed. Since my scheme for determining GUIDs is new, I didn&#8217;t want to spam people with a bunch of posts that are quite old. Also quite easy with Jekyll.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I&#8217;m quite happy with my new blog setup. It will help me blog more frequently.</p></div>

  <p class="date">February 1st, 2011</p>
  <div class="entry"><p>Okay, so it seems like over the last few years, so many of my blog posts are &#8220;I am still alive&#8221; or &#8220;long time no see, I&#8217;m going to start blogging again.&#8221;</p>

<p>The problem is that I&#8217;ve thought of this blog as a technical blog for so long, and so when I want to talk about other things, I&#8217;ve felt I couldn&#8217;t post them here. But, as my better half told me today, &#8220;It&#8217;s called <em>Alieniloquent</em>. It&#8217;s almost perverse for it to be a single-topic blog.&#8221;</p>

<p>So, I&#8217;m going to start blogging about several topics that interest me: programming, knitting, cooking, parenting, politics, and whatever else strikes my fancy. I&#8217;m going to make an effort to tag things appropriately so that if you want to just follow certain kinds of posts, you can.</p>

<p>So, long time no see. I&#8217;m going to start blogging again.</p></div>
