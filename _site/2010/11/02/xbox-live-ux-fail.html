  <h3><a href="/2010/11/02/xbox-live-ux-fail.html" title="Permalink for this post">XBox Live UX Fail</a></h3>
  <p class="date">November 2nd, 2010</p>
  <div class="entry"><h3 id='the_story'>The Story</h3>

<p>Today I received an email from Microsoft. They wanted to let me know that in about a month, my XBox Live Gold membership was going to automatically renew. I really appreciate the notice because I don&#8217;t own an XBox any more, so it was time to cancel.</p>

<p>I clicked on the link provided in the email they sent me. Navigated the site to the page with the link to manage my account billing, and clicked on the link. &#8220;Oops, an error occurred.&#8221; I navigated back, and tried something else. &#8220;Oops, an error occurred.&#8221; In fact, no matter what I tried to do on the site, aside from look at the list of things I could (not) do caused an error to occur.</p>

<p>Fine, I thought, I&#8217;ll just call the phone number. I closed the window out of frustration and picked up the phone. As I navigated the phone tree, I was kindly reminded that I&#8217;d need details from my account, such as my gamertag. Well shit, I don&#8217;t remember that stuff, so I logged back in.</p>

<p>I was greeted with a page insisting I accept their new Terms of Service. I had no way to proceed to the rest of the site without checking a box saying I&#8217;d read them, and then clicking a button to proceed. So I did that, and a horde of trained mice swarmed over their database to update the bit on my user account record that said I&#8217;d agreed to the new terms.</p>

<p>Greeted, once again, with the page that offered to me all the things I could do on their website, I clicked the link to manage my billing details. It worked just fine. After hanging up the phone, I went through the multi-page attempt to try and save me from cancellation (&#8220;But you won&#8217;t be able to watch Netflix on your XBox. Have you heard about these games? Maybe you want to go month-to-month?&#8221;) and turned off my auto-renewal setting.</p>

<h3 id='the_fail'>The Fail</h3>

<p>There was actually two parts to the UX fail. The first was the lame, and at one point seemingly-never-ending, attempt to save me from cancelling my auto- renewal. I just wanted to turn off a setting, and I had to click through about five pages of completely unrelated bullshit to get to the radio switch that let me do that. The second part of the fail was a bit more subtle, and is probably a bug in the XBox Live site.</p>

<p>When companies change their terms of service, they like to ensure that you cannot do anything until you have accepted them. Products with a piece of client software (e.g. EVE Online, iTunes) can simply disallow access until you&#8217;ve clicked the appropriate widget. But websites are a bit more complicated. The vendor cannot control your web surfing experience. All they can control is what content they display to you. At first blush, that seems like a simple problem, just redirect if the user hasn&#8217;t accepted the TOS. But, when your site has several possible paths a user can follow to enter, that simple solution becomes vastly more complex.</p>

<p>My theory of what happened is that the link I clicked in my email went through a route in their site that was <em>not</em> wrapped in the code to see if I&#8217;d accepted the new TOS. That allowed me access to my user portal. However, <em>all</em> of the functionality was coded to verify I had accepted the TOS and (probably) raise an exception if I had not. So, everything I tried to do gave me an unexpected error. But, when I logged out, and came in through the <em>usual</em> route, I was presented with the TOS, the flag was set, and everything worked.</p></div>
