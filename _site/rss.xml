      <description><![CDATA[<p>I know I promised more blogging. I know it&#8217;s been weeks. I <em>have</em> been working on my blog, just behind the scenes.</p>

<p>I decided that if I was going to start blogging seriously, I did not want to be doing it in a web form. I&#8217;ve been using <a href='http://wordpress.org/'>WordPress</a> for a long time now, and the biggest thing that has always bugged me were my options for actually typing in my blog posts. Web forms suck for writing. I&#8217;d rather use Emacs.</p>

<p>Now, I realize there&#8217;s ways to use Emacs to post to WordPress. I&#8217;m not interested. The second thing that bugged me about my old setup is the database. This is a blog. Except for comments and track-backs, it is essentially static content. There is no reason to bring a database into this transaction.</p>

<p>So, I started considering doing something simple that would generate my content statically. I could store it in a Git repository and push it up to my server. That&#8217;s when I remembered <a href='http://jekyllrb.com'>Jekyll</a>. It was pretty much exactly what I wanted, and it&#8217;s written in Ruby, so I&#8217;ll be comfortable hacking on it when the need arises.</p>

<p>The trouble was that Jekyll doesn&#8217;t have a lot of built-in generation options. It will generate a page for each post, and it will run any extra files through its template expansion, but for things like archive pages some extra code is needed. But, Jekyll provides a plugin mechanism that is more than adequate to allow for extension.</p>

<p>As part of this migration, I&#8217;ve decided to remove the commenting and track-backing functionality from my blog. Experience has shown that I don&#8217;t really get much in the way of comments, and I believe there are better ways to facilitate discussion. If, later, I feel that I should have comments, I&#8217;ll probably use <a href='http://disqus.com'>Disqus</a>.</p>

<p>I also made a little tweak so that only new posts should show up in the RSS feed. Since my scheme for determining GUIDs is new, I didn&#8217;t want to spam people with a bunch of posts that are quite old. Also quite easy with Jekyll.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I&#8217;m quite happy with my new blog setup. It will help me blog more frequently.</p>]]></description>
