      <description><![CDATA[<p>I know I promised more blogging. I know it&#8217;s been weeks. I <em>have</em> been working on my blog, just behind the scenes.</p>

<p>I decided that if I was going to start blogging seriously, I did not want to be doing it in a web form. I&#8217;ve been using <a href='http://wordpress.org/'>WordPress</a> for a long time now, and the biggest thing that has always bugged me were my options for actually typing in my blog posts. Web forms suck for writing. I&#8217;d rather use Emacs.</p>

<p>Now, I realize there&#8217;s ways to use Emacs to post to WordPress. I&#8217;m not interested. The second thing that bugged me about my old setup is the database. This is a blog. Except for comments and track-backs, it is essentially static content. There is no reason to bring a database into this transaction.</p>

<p>So, I started considering doing something simple that would generate my content statically. I could store it in a Git repository and push it up to my server. That&#8217;s when I remembered <a href='http://jekyllrb.com'>Jekyll</a>. It was pretty much exactly what I wanted, and it&#8217;s written in Ruby, so I&#8217;ll be comfortable hacking on it when the need arises.</p>

<p>The trouble was that Jekyll doesn&#8217;t have a lot of built-in generation options. It will generate a page for each post, and it will run any extra files through its template expansion, but for things like archive pages some extra code is needed. But, Jekyll provides a plugin mechanism that is more than adequate to allow for extension.</p>

<p>As part of this migration, I&#8217;ve decided to remove the commenting and track-backing functionality from my blog. Experience has shown that I don&#8217;t really get much in the way of comments, and I believe there are better ways to facilitate discussion. If, later, I feel that I should have comments, I&#8217;ll probably use <a href='http://disqus.com'>Disqus</a>.</p>

<p>I also made a little tweak so that only new posts should show up in the RSS feed. Since my scheme for determining GUIDs is new, I didn&#8217;t want to spam people with a bunch of posts that are quite old. Also quite easy with Jekyll.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I&#8217;m quite happy with my new blog setup. It will help me blog more frequently.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>I write to you on your estimated due date. You haven&#8217;t been born just yet, but I know you will be here soon. I am filled with impatience, excitement and anxiety. Impatient for what will most certainly be one of the most joyous events of my life; excited to meet and hold the most amazing thing I have helped bring into this world; and anxious that I am not prepared.</p>

<p>I want you to know that I love you. Mom loves you. We love you unconditionally. That means we love you no matter what, and when we say no matter what, we really mean it. We love you and we accept you for who you are, and who you want to be. We may not always understand you, we may not always agree with you, we may not always approve of your decisions, but we will always love you, and we will always accept you. Always. Unconditionally.</p>

<p>There is so much that I want to share with you; so many amazing things. I can&#8217;t wait to teach you about anything you want to know. We&#8217;ll have years to learn everything we can imagine. But, there is something I think it&#8217;s so important that you learn, that I want to start teaching it to you before you&#8217;re even born.</p>

<p>Always be respectful of people. Be respectful of those you agree with, and of those you disagree with. Be respectful of men, and of women. Be respectful of people like you, and of people unlike you. Be respectful of people regardless of their race, sex, gender, sexuality, beliefs, occupation, hobbies, habits, or other attributes. People deserve to be treated with respect. All people. Every single one.</p>

<p>If you never listen to anything else I say, please listen to this.</p>

<p>Love,</p>

<p>Dad</p>]]></description>
